# NASCAR Simulation

## Overview

This C++ program simulates a NASCAR race with multiple cars on different types of tracks. The simulation includes aspects like fuel consumption, tire management, and lap time calculations.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (supporting at least C++11)
- Standard Template Library (STL) support

## How to Run

1. **Download the Source Code:**
   - Clone this repository or download the source code files.

2. **Compile the Code:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
   - Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example:
     ```bash
     g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o nascar_simulation
     ```
     Replace `g++` with the appropriate compiler command on your system.

3. **Run the Program:**
   - After successful compilation, run the executable:
     ```bash
     ./nascar_simulation
     ```
     Replace `./nascar_simulation` with the correct executable name on your system.

4. **View the Results:**
   - The program will simulate a NASCAR race with predefined parameters.
   - The final standings will be displayed at the end of the simulation.

## Configuration (Optional)

You can modify the initial parameters of the cars and tracks in the `main.cpp` file to experiment with different scenarios.
